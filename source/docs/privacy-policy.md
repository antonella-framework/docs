Personal data is collected and processed in accordance with GDPR and LOPDGDD. Data comes directly from the data subject and may be collected through the following means on the website:

- **Public support section:** In the area provided to leave questions or doubts about the framework, the user may voluntarily publish messages including their name or alias, email address, and any other personal information they decide to include.

The legal bases for processing personal data collected through this website are:

- **Consent of the data subject (Art. 6.1.a GDPR):** For processing data voluntarily provided by the user via the contact form or widget, we will request explicit consent. This consent may be withdrawn at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent prior to its withdrawal.
- **Legitimate interest of the controller (Art. 6.1.f GDPR):** In certain cases, processing may be based on the CONTROLLER’s legitimate interest to handle spontaneous requests received via email or analyze possible website errors, provided the user’s interests or fundamental rights do not prevail.

In any case, processing is carried out in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and data will not be used for purposes other than those expressly informed.

## 5. Purposes of Processing

Personal data collected through the website will be processed for the following legitimate purposes:

- Manage inquiries and requests submitted by users through the technical support area on the website, where users may leave questions or comments about the framework, collecting minimal identification data (such as name or email) if necessary to respond. Also manage those received via other contact channels such as the contact widget or phone.
- Respond to communications received by email regarding the operation of the framework, collaborations, or technical matters.
- Send informational communications about updates or news related to the framework, exclusively if the user has provided explicit and unequivocal consent.
- Comply with legal obligations arising from applicable regulations, especially regarding personal data protection, information society services, or site security.

Additionally, personal data may be processed for the following complementary purposes:

- Ensure compliance with the website’s terms of use and any other applicable regulations.
- Improve the quality, functionality, and security of the website through technical analysis of usage and user browsing, including the use of cookies as detailed in the [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy).
- Manage the CONTROLLER’s presence on external platforms such as GitHub, Gitter, or social networks, in accordance with the terms established by those platforms, to inform the technical community about new releases, resources, or related events. These channels will not be used to send unsolicited commercial communications.

In all cases, the personal data processed will be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes described, and will not be used for different purposes without prior notice to the user and, where appropriate, new consent.

## 6. Retention Period

Data will be kept no longer than necessary to maintain the purpose of processing or as long as there are legal requirements mandating its retention. When no longer necessary, it will be deleted with appropriate security measures to ensure anonymization or total destruction.

## 7. Recipients

Personal data will not be transferred or disclosed to third parties, except where required by law or, if necessary to carry out the purposes of processing, to our service providers related to communications, with whom the CONTROLLER has signed the confidentiality and data processing agreements required by current privacy regulations.

## 8. Your Rights

Applicable data protection legislation recognizes a series of rights for you as a user who has provided your data, including the right to:

- Request access to personal data concerning you  
- Request rectification or erasure  
- Request restriction of processing  
- Object to processing  
- Data portability  
- Withdraw consent at any time

You also have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether we are processing personal data concerning you on our website.

To exercise your rights, you may send a request by email to empresas@carlos-herrera.com, attaching a copy of your identity document. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) if you believe that the processing of your personal data does not comply with the law: https://www.aepd.es.

## 9. Categories of Data

The categories of data we process on our website are limited to identification data. We do not process special categories of data. If, exceptionally, we receive such data voluntarily provided by the user, we will proceed to delete it as far as possible. The user undertakes not to provide special categories of data under any circumstances.

## 10. Accuracy and Truthfulness of Data

As a user, you are responsible for ensuring that the personal data you provide through this website is truthful, accurate, complete, and up to date, holding the CONTROLLER harmless from any liability in this regard.

Users agree to keep their data duly updated and not to provide false or inaccurate information during the use of the support area or in any communication made through the website or enabled channels.

Likewise, the user agrees not to provide third-party personal data without having previously obtained their explicit consent. If they do, they will be solely responsible for such communication, assuming any obligation or legal consequence arising therefrom, and expressly exonerating the CONTROLLER from any liability before third parties.

## 11. User Consent

The user acknowledges having been informed about the conditions of personal data protection, expressing their agreement and giving consent for the website owner to process such data in accordance with the terms and purposes detailed in this Privacy Policy.

If the user is under fourteen years of age, the consent of parents or guardians is required to process their personal data. Under no circumstances will data related to the minor’s professional, economic situation, or the privacy of other family members be requested without their consent. If you are under fourteen and have accessed this website without informing your parents, you must not register as a user or provide information.

## 12. Revocability

Consent may be withdrawn at any time by communicating with the website owner, as established in this Policy for exercising ARCO-POL rights. This revocation will not affect actions already carried out prior to withdrawal.

## 13. Commercial Emails

In compliance with the LSSI, this website does not send unsolicited emails (SPAM). Commercial emails will not be sent unless the user has previously requested or authorized them. In all forms available on the website, the user may provide express consent to receive a newsletter, without this interfering with the receipt of specific commercial information explicitly requested. As provided by Law 34/2002 on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, this website guarantees that commercial communications will not be sent unless clearly identified as such.

## 14. Data Secrecy and Security

This website is committed to ensuring the confidentiality of users’ personal data in its use and handling, as well as using it in accordance with its specific purpose. We undertake to comply with the obligation to preserve it, applying all necessary measures to prevent alteration, loss, processing, or unauthorized access, as stipulated by current data protection regulations.

This website adopts the necessary measures to guarantee the security, integrity, and confidentiality of data in accordance with GDPR.

Nevertheless, the website owner cannot guarantee the absolute impregnability of the Internet and, therefore, the violation of data through fraudulent access by third parties.

Regarding processing confidentiality, the website owner undertakes to ensure that all persons authorized by this site to process customer data—including staff, collaborators, and suppliers—are subject to the appropriate duty of confidentiality, whether by contractual or legal obligation.

In the event of a security incident, the website owner will notify the customer without undue delay and provide relevant information about the incident as soon as it becomes known, or when reasonably requested by the customer.

## 15. Legal Information and Future Changes

The provisions of this Policy serve as a supplement and not as a substitute for any other requirement established by applicable data protection regulations, which shall take precedence in any situation. This Policy is reviewed regularly and the company reserves the right to modify it at any time. In case of changes, you will be notified and asked to review the most recent version of our Policy and confirm your acceptance.
