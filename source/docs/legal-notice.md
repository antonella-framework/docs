If such interruption affects registered users or contracted services, reasonable prior notice will be provided when possible.

The CONTROLLER does not guarantee continuous availability, uninterrupted access, or full functionality of the website, its content, or features. Access and browsing may be affected by factors beyond the reasonable control of the owner, such as technical failures, power outages, or telecommunications issues.

Likewise, the CONTROLLER declines any responsibility for decisions users may make based on information published on this website, or for any damages that may result from its use or the services offered herein, unless gross negligence or willful misconduct by the owner is proven.

The CONTROLLER may immediately cancel or suspend access to the website for any user when use contrary to these conditions, applicable regulations, or principles of good faith is detected. This is without prejudice to legal actions to defend the interests of the CONTROLLER or third parties.

### 6.1 Grounds for Exemption from Liability

- Interference, interruptions, or failures in the electronic system caused by deficiencies, overloads, errors in telecommunications lines, or causes beyond the control of the CONTROLLER.  
- Unlawful intrusions by third parties through malicious software (such as viruses, malware, spyware, or any harmful code) that may alter the normal operation of the website or cause damage to users’ computer systems.  
- Improper use of the website by the user, contrary to this Legal Notice, the law, or good faith, including abusive, fraudulent, or disproportionate use of the available features.  
- Navigation errors or technical incompatibilities caused by outdated or misconfigured browsers, as well as any failures arising from the user’s devices.

The CONTROLLER reserves the right to remove, in whole or in part, any content hosted on the website that may contravene applicable regulations, public order, or the rights of third parties. This may be exercised on its own initiative or as a result of notifications or requirements from any competent administrative or judicial authority.

### 6.2 Forms and User-Generated Content

The CONTROLLER is exempt from any responsibility for content, opinions, or comments that may be submitted by users through contact forms or other interactive mechanisms, which are enabled solely for informational and inquiry purposes.

The user will be directly liable for any damages caused by unlawful, negligent, or willful use of these services and agrees to hold the CONTROLLER harmless from any claims arising from the use of these channels.

### 6.3 Indemnification and Abusive Use of Automated Tools

The user expressly agrees to indemnify the CONTROLLER against any damage, loss, or cost (including legal fees and court expenses) arising from third-party claims, actions, or demands resulting from the user’s improper use of the website, breach of this Legal Notice, or use of automated tools for unauthorized purposes.

In particular, the use of systems such as “robots,” “spiders,” “crawlers,” or any similar technology intended to collect data, massively access the site’s pages, or generate an unjustified overload on the CONTROLLER’s servers is prohibited.

## 7. Links Policy (Hyperlinks)

The User agrees not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit for commercial purposes any part of the Website or its contents, including code snippets, documentation, or graphic materials, without the CONTROLLER’s express written authorization.

The Website may include links to third-party websites to facilitate User access to additional resources related to WordPress development, free software, or technical documentation. The CONTROLLER is not responsible for the content of such external sites, does not act as a guarantor, and does not endorse the products, services, or information that may be offered through them.

A limited, revocable, and non-exclusive right is granted to Users to create links to the Website’s homepage, exclusively for private, personal, and non-commercial use. Websites that include links to our Website must meet the following conditions:

i) They may not misrepresent their relationship with the CONTROLLER or claim approval or sponsorship where none exists.  
ii) They may not include trademarks, logos, or other distinctive signs owned by the CONTROLLER without authorization.  
iii) They may not contain content contrary to law, morality, or public order, or content that is offensive or inappropriate.  
iv) They may not link to internal sections of the Website other than the homepage.  
v) They may not reproduce the Website within frames or use techniques that alter its original presentation.

The CONTROLLER may request the removal of unauthorized links at any time, and the owner of the linking site must immediately remove them. Likewise, the CONTROLLER cannot control information, contents, products, or services provided by third parties that link to this Website and, therefore, assumes no responsibility for such elements.

## 8. Declarations and Warranties

In general, the content and services offered through this website are for informational and educational purposes aimed at developers interested in using the Antonella framework to create plugins in WordPress environments. Consequently, the CONTROLLER makes no warranty or representation regarding the lawfulness, reliability, usefulness, truthfulness, accuracy, or merchantability of such content, except where the law does not permit its exclusion.

In particular, the information contained in the documentation, blog, or any other section that includes technical guides, code examples, best practices, or recommendations for use of the framework is for guidance only and in no case replaces the analysis, review, or professional validation of the code developed by the user.

Such content does not constitute individualized technical advice nor does it create any contractual obligation on the part of the CONTROLLER. The CONTROLLER shall not be liable for damages, losses, or decisions arising from the use or interpretation of the content published without proper verification by the developer.

The user acknowledges that any technical action taken based on the content of the website is at their sole responsibility. In this regard, the CONTROLLER recommends reviewing official WordPress documentation and performing controlled tests before implementing functionalities in production environments.

Furthermore, the CONTROLLER does not guarantee that the content of the website will always be updated, complete, or error-free, although reasonable efforts will be made to correct any inaccuracies detected and keep information updated in line with technological developments and applicable regulations on free software development.

## 9. Force Majeure

The CONTROLLER shall not be liable in cases where the provision of service is impossible due to prolonged power outages, telecommunications lines failures, social conflicts, strikes, uprisings, explosions, floods, acts and omissions of the Government, and, in general, all cases of force majeure or fortuitous events.

## 10. Dispute Resolution. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction

These General Terms of Use included in this Legal Notice, as well as the use of the Website, shall be governed by Spanish law. For the resolution of any disputes, the parties submit to the Courts and Tribunals of the CONTROLLER’s domicile.

If any provision of these General Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or null under applicable law or as a result of a judicial or administrative decision, such unenforceability or nullity shall not render the remaining provisions unenforceable or null as a whole. In such cases, the CONTROLLER will modify or replace the affected provision with another that is valid and enforceable and, to the extent possible, achieves the objective and intent of the original provision.
